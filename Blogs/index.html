                <h3>Kushinagar</h3>
                <h5>About my place:</h5>
                <p>
                    Kushinagar is a significant Buddhist pilgrimage site located in Uttar Pradesh, India. It holds immense 
                    historical and spiritual importance as it is believed to be the place where Gautama Buddha attained 
                    Mahaparinirvana (final nirvana) after his death.

                <h5>Historical Significance</h5>
                <p>
                    Kushinagar, known as Kusinara in ancient times, was the capital of one of the two Malla republics 
                    during the 6th century BCE. It remained an integral part of various empires, including the Maurya, 
                    Shunga, Kushana, Gupta, Harsha, and Pala dynasties. The town is home to several ancient Buddhist 
                    monasteries and stupas, with the Parinirvana Stupa being one of the most prominent landmarks.

                <h5>Modern Developments</h5>
                <p>
                    In recent years, efforts have been made to develop Kushinagar as an international tourist destination. 
                    The Indian government has focused on improving infrastructure, lighting, and amenities to facilitate 
                    visitors, including those with disabilities. The inauguration of an international airport in 2021 has 
                    further boosted tourism, making it easier for pilgrims and tourists from around the world to visit.

            <h3>My Journey in Java Full Stack Development</h3>

                This journey involves mastering Core Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and RESTful APIs.
                I am learning to build fully functional web applications, handling everything from database management to user interface design.

            <h3>Earning from Airdrops</h3>
            <p>
                Apart from my technical learning, I am also earning money through airdrops. 
                Airdrops are free cryptocurrency distributions by blockchain projects to promote their tokens.
                 By actively participating in these campaigns, completing tasks, and engaging with crypto communities, I have been able to generate a decent passive income.
                 This experience has also helped me learn about blockchain, crypto trading, and the evolving world of decentralized finance (DeFi).
